Building
========

	Windows
	=======

	To build pymssql on Windows you firstly must have:

		* MinGW
            * If you wish to use Visual C++ >= 2005 (or some equivalent compiler) then you will have
              to compile FreeTDS yourself.
		* Python >= 2.5 (From the Python website)
		* Cython >= 0.13

	and then you can simple run:

		python setup.py build

	which will build pymssql in the normal python fashion.

	Unix
	====

	To build on Unix you must have:

		* gcc
		* python-dev >= 2.5
		* Cython >= 0.13
		* FreeTDS >= 0.82

Testing
=======

To run the tests simply go to the "tests" folder and execute:

	python all.py

Which will go through and run all the tests with the default server
settings. If you wish to change these settings you can create a 'tests.cfg'
file in the tests folder that gets read for server settings. This file
should have the format:

[DEFAULT]
# in order for the tests to work correctly, the value for server
# SHOULD NOT appear in any freetds.conf file.  Ideally, the test DB server
# would be a non-default instance which allows full tests of the instance
# and port parameters.
server = hostname
# IP Address should be included as well as it allows us to test connections
# to the database in different ways.
ipaddress = 192.168.1.1
username = username
password = password
database = database
# optional
port = 1433
# optional
instance = 

[AllTestsWillRun]
server = hostname
ipaddress = 192.168.1.1
username = username
username = someuser
password = somepass
database = somedb
port = 1435
instance = testinst

When this file exists you can run any test specifying a server as the first argument to the command such as:

	python all.py SomeServer
