<p>The pymssql package consists of two extension modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>pymssql</b>. This is the DB-API compliant module. Use it if your 
primary goal is to follow DB-API standard.
<br /><br />
</li>
<li><b>_mssql</b>. This is lower level module that talks directly 
to SQL Server. It has many useful features. You can use it if you 
don&#39;t need DB-API compliance. It&#39;s pretty straighforward to use, 
as you will find below.
</li>
</ul>
