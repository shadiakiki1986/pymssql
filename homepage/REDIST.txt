----------------------------------------------


INSTALLATION NOTES FOR PIVOTTABLE SERVICE
-----------------------------------------

PivotTable Service includes a number of DLLs that you may need to ship with a client application. Any individual client application may need a combination of these components, depending on the PivotTable Service features it uses. 

File Set 1: 
	Msolap80.dll, 
	Msolui80.dll, 
        Olapuir.rll,
	Msolap80.rll, and 
	Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC)

File Set 2: 
	File Set 1 plus 
	Msmdcb80.dll, 
	Msmdgd80.dll, and 
	an appropriate OLE DB tabular data provider 

File Set 3:
	File Set 1 plus 
	Msdmine.dll, 
	Msdmine.rll, and 
	Msdmeng.dll 

The following Task-FileSet pairs show which file set to use based on which tasks you want your client application to perform:

	Task: Communicate with the Analysis server using TCP/IP or HTTP 
	File Set: 1 

	Task: Read multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP) local cube files
	File Set: 1 

	Task: Read relational OLAP (ROLAP) local cube files
	File Set: 1 

	Task: Create and refresh local cubes 
	File Set: 2 

	Task: Read OLAP and relational data mining models
	File Set: 3 

You must install MDAC before you install PivotTable Service. File sets 2 and 3 can be combined if the entire suite of components is desired. If you install PivotTable Service with Microsoft Windows 95, you must install distributed COM (DCOM) before you install MDAC. For more information about distributing and installing MDAC, see the MSDN Library at http://msdn.microsoft.com/.

The PivotTable(r) Service files, with the exception of the resource files (files with an extension of .rll) must be installed to the following location:

	"System Drive"\Program Files\Common Files\System\OLE DB

After the required components have been installed, the following components must also be registered using Regsvr32.exe or their own DLLSelfRegister functions: 

	Msolap80.dll
	Msolui80.dll
	Msmdgd80.dll
	Msmdcb80.dll
	Msdmine.dll
	Msdmeng.dll 

The resource files, Msolap80.rll, Olapuir.rll, and Msdmine.rll, must be installed to the following location:

	"System Drive"\Program Files\Common Files\System\OLE DB\Resources\1033

When registering DLLs, observe the following dependencies: 

(a) Msolap80.dll depends on Msolap80.rll, Wininet.dll, and Oleaut32.dll version 2.3.0 or later;

(b) Msolap80.rll is the resource file for Msolap80.dll. Oleaut32 is the OLE Automation run-time library, and is also installed in either the C:\Windows\System or C:\Winnt\System32 directories

(c) Msolui80.dll depends on Msolap80.dll, Olapuir.rll, Msvbvm60.dll, and Oleaut32.dll version 2.3.0 or later. 

Msvbvm60.dll is a Microsoft Visual Basic run-time library, and Wininet.dll contains the Internet automation run-time library. Both are installed in the C:\Windows\System or C:\Winnt\System32 directory.

Note  You can use the Depends.exe utility, which is available in the Windows NT(r) Resource Kit, to see the full set of external dependencies for these DLLs.

Installation Registry Settings
For the purposes of installing and uninstalling, all PivotTable(r) Service files should be considered shared files. Create a registry value for each PivotTable Service file under the following registry key:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SharedDLLs

If this registry value (known as the reference counter) already exists, it should be incremented by one during installation of the PivotTable Service files. During removal of the PivotTable Service files, the reference counter should be decremented by one. The PivotTable Service files should not be deleted if the corresponding reference counter is greater than zero.

Two setup programs, Ptslite.exe and Ptsfull.exe, are provided on the SQL Server 2000 CD-ROM, in the folder \Msolap\Install\Pts. Ptslite.exe installs the PivotTable Service files only; Ptsfull.exe installs the PivotTable Service files and Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC).

In addition to two required parameters, both Ptslite.exe and Ptsfull.exe use the same optional command line parameters as the Analysis Services Setup program. The required parameters, which must be the first parameters on the command line, are -s and -a. Optional parameters follow these required parameters. For example, to use Ptslite.exe to perform a silent installation of the PivotTable Service files, the command is:

	Ptslite -s -a -s -f1Setup.iss ...

The PTS files listed as "version 7.0" are included for backwards compatibility only.


INSTALLATION NOTES FOR DECISION SUPPORT OBJECTS (DSO)
-----------------------------------------------------
Unlike Microsoft PivotTable Service files that are required by clients that connect to Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services, DSO files are optional.  DSO is only required for running programs that need to manage OLAP Service objects, such as dimension maintenance, cube processing, and virtual dimension creation.

Before installing DSO, ensure that Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) and PivotTable Service have been installed.

DSO is only supported on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.  It is not supported on Windows 95 or Windows 98.  Microsoft PivotTable Service must be installed before you install DSO.

The DSO files should be installed in the following sequence.  Each of these files must be registered.
	msmdnet.dll
	msmdlock.dll
	msmddo.dll

These files must reside in the following folder:

	"system drive"\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DSO

The resource file, Msmdso.rll, does not need to be registered and is installed by default in the following location:

	"system drive"\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DSO\Resources\1033

When registering DLLs, the following dependency should be observed: msmddo80.dll depends on msvbvm60.dll.  msvbvm60.dll is a Visual Basic run-time library installed in the \winnt\system32 folder.

The depends.exe utility, available in the Windows NT Resource Kit, can be used to see the full set of external dependencies.

To register the DLL files, you should use Regsvr32.exe or their own DLLSelfRegister() functions. Additionally, registry entries for each file should be made under the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SharedDLLs

If this registry value (known as the reference counter) already exists, it should be incremented by one during installation of the DSO files.  When uninstalling the DSO files, the reference counter should be decremented by one.  The DSO files should not be deleted if the corresponding reference counter is greater than 0.

For more information about setup design specifications, refer to http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/uiguide/.

Maintaining Backward Compatibility:

The backward compatibility files that are included with Analysis Services (that is, Msmddo.dll and Msmdsgn.dll) are not compatible with the files of the same name that were included with SQL Server 7.0 OLAP Services (that is, the 7.0 versions of these files). Use the following rules to assist you in determining which files to install: 

If the application will only be used with SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services, Msmddo80.dll, Msmdnet.dll, Msmdlock.dll, and Msmdso.rll must be installed on the target computer.

If the application will also be used with SQL Server 7.0 OLAP Services, Msmddo.dll must be installed. If the 7.0 version of this file already exists on the target computer, it must be replaced with the newer version. 


INSTALLATION NOTES FOR ENGLISH QUERY
------------------------------------
When including English Query capability in an application, the English Query run-time DLLs accompany the application. The exception to redistributing the English Query DLLs occurs when the English Query application is deployed on a Web server. In this case, the English Query runtime only needs to be installed on the Web server.

Mseqgrqb.ocx and Mseqgrqb.cab are Microsoft(r) ActiveX(r) controls used to enhance the use of English Query models. For applications deployed to a Web site, end users can download these files from the site. It is neither necessary nor permissible to allow end users to download the English Query system DLLs from the Web. 

Redistributing the English Query runtime involves copying all of the English Query DLLs and registering the necessary DLLs when the application is installed. If you need to redistribute the English Query DLLs, all users of English Query must be licensed Microsoft(r) SQL Server(tm) users. Because the application usually accesses SQL Server data, each English Query user must have a SQL Server client access license. 

You can redistribute the files shown in this table with an English Query application.

	File name	Description

	Mseqole.dll	English Query Server object model
	Mseqbase.dll	English Query supplemental file
	Mseqsql.dll	English Query supplemental file
	Mseqmsg.dll	English Query supplemental file
	Mseqconn.dll	English Query supplemental file
	Mseqcore.eqd	English Query supplemental file
	Mseqgrqb.ocx	English Query Question Builder Microsoft ActiveX(r) control
	Mseqgrqb.cab	English Query cabinet file containing:
				Mseqgrqb.ocx, 
				the Help file (.chm); and 
				the .inf file that tells Microsoft Internet Explorer: 
					where to copy the files, 
					how to register the .ocx file, and 
					how to uninstall the control.

When English Query is installed, these files are installed by default in the \Program Files\Common Files\System\EQ80 directory. The English Query application or Setup installs these files to this common directory, or creates it if it does not exist, before registering them. The compiled English Query application (.eqd), for example Northwind.eqd, is copied to the end user's computer. By default, the .eqd file is located in the same directory that is used by the rest of the application.

Registering the Necessary English Query Files:

Both Mseqole.dll and Mseqgrqb.ocx must be registered using the Regsvr32.exe utility.

The following English Query files must be registered using the regsvr32.exe utility:

	To register Mseqole.dll, use "\path to the dll\Mseqole.dll", for example:

		Regsvr32 "\Program Files\Common Files\System\EQ80\Mseqole.dll"

	To register Mseqgrqb.ocx, use "\path to the location of the ActiveX controls\Mseqgrqb.ocx", for example:

		Regsvr32 "\Program Files\Common Files\System\EQ80\Mseqgrqb.ocx"

If you do not want the end users to see the dialog box that confirms successful registration, use the /s (silent) switch:
Regsvr32 "\Program Files\Common Files\System\EQ80\Mseqole.dll" /s
	
If you want to clean up the end users' registries when English Query is uninstalled, use the /u (uninstall) switch:
Regsvr32 "\Program Files\Common Files\System\EQ80\Mseqole.dll" /u
